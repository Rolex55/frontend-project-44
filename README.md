### Description:
This repository is created for playing five brain games. It includes brain-even game, where you need to determine even and odd numbers, brain-calc game to calculate math expressions, brain-gcd game to determine the greatest common divisor, brain-progression game to fill missing number in the progression and brain-prime game to determine prime numbers. The execution of all games can be found at links.
